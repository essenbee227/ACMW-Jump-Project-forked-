### What is Git?
Git is an Open-source, distrubited version control system that is designed to handle **EVERYTHING**, from small projects to large ones with speed, efficiency and ease.

It allows developers to follow changes in the code, return to the previous versions, and collaborate without any conflicts.

### Why should you use Git?
Here are some of my favourite features of Git:

* Version Control: We can easily track the changes made in the code and revert back to the original code.
* Backup and Recovery: You can keep a complete history of your project to recover any lost changes
* Easy Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting another members work.
* Open source: Its free :)
* Security: Git uses cryptographic methods to secure integrity.

there are numerous other reasons to use git which you can read [here.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-features/)

### Installing Git
Now that I've convinced you to use git her are some important Git commands you should know:
1. Configuring Git

after setting up a name and email in git 
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
2. Intialize a Repository 

` git init `

3. Cloning a Repositary

` git clone <repository-url> `

### Conclusion
Thus I can say that Git is a Powerful Tool for developers, by mastering these commands, you can *work on projects, track changes and collaborate* with ease.

As you deal more with Git you can explore advanced Git features like Stash, rebasing and interactive rebase.
